A number of things to keep in mind, that often appear as surprises.

* ffmpeg concat allow for a list of files, which is very convenient, but it's not quite a mere list. No, the filenames must held in single quotes (NOT double)
and preceded by the keyword "file", and of course space.

* you might make some discoveries and you'll want to know where they come from! Keep your listings files, and give me them decent names.

* watch the clips that have almost nothing at all. This maybe because of some problem, often the filenames, but it could be something else.

* What's a good clip what a good clip duration? 15 sec ain;t too bad, but I have a feeling 30sec is prob best
